## Branches: 

1. `Main` Branch: This will be your stable branch, where only the finalized, approved code is merged.
2. `Code-Review` Branch: Contributors will push their code.

## Rules: 
- A Code Review was done during the practicing session. then will push code into main branch.


## How to Contribute
- Clone the repository and switch to the `code-review` branch.
- Push your changes to `code-review`.
- The maintainer will review and merge your changes into the `main` branch.

## Steps:
1. Commit Code
2. Clone code
3. Git fork

## Git Command uses:

1. Git add . -adding all to commit from the directory
2. Git commit -m ‘text for update’
3. Git checkout -b <branch name>  // create new branch, and change one branch to another git checkout <branch name> 
4. git remote add origin https://github.com/Pruthvi-tgr/assignment1.git // adding git
5. Git pull - is to create pull requests and this helps in comparing 2 branches with the latest commit, then we can code review next will be code merge. 
6. After committing the code we need to clean the current directory: create a .gitignore file and add all file like: *.txt, readme
7. Git show <log id>- will show recent action on/for git log id will gwt from         ‘git log --oneline’
8. To reverse git commit - git revert <logid/commit id> 
9. To add branches  - git branch <brnach name>
10. Branch switch - git checkout  <branch name> / git checkout  -b <branch name> create new branch and switch
11. Git stash (usually used to remove or hide the feature that is ruled out / old one)
